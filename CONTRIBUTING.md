# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in dsga (Data Stuctures for Geometric Algorithms)! I am far from perfect and may make some design decisions that aren't optimal, so any feedback is appreciated. Please take a moment to review this document **before submitting any issues**.

## Issues

For the time being, the main type of contribution I am looking for is Issue reporting. Any bugs or design flaws or feature suggestions are appreciated. This is a one person development team, and there are many things that may have been overlooked. I hope to have robust discussions in the Issue tracking as we fix or add things to the project.

## What About PRs?

I am not currently in a position to handle Pull Requests. I have a vision of where and how I want this project to go, and I don't think I am ready to have contributors directly changing the code. If there are programming suggestions that you have to improve the project, please create an issue with all the necessary detail.

If you feel limited by this, please feel free to fork the project and make it the way you want it.

## Things That Are Needed

There are a few known missing parts to this project, and probably many other parts that are unknown (by me).
* Robust Documentation - currently relying heavily on the GLSL 4.6 Language Specification (and some of the C++ specification)
* CMake Support for a Single Header Library and Testing Program - I don't really know CMake
* Complete Test Coverage - I have an idea to make this better, it would just take a long time
* Automated CI/CD - I don't know how to get GitHub to do this. I manually do this now, with many compilers and both Windows and Linux (WSL).

Probably most of this would benefit from allowing PRs, but until I am more familiar with Git and PR handling, and feeling a general ease with allowing others direct access, I am going to handle this as I get to it. If you want to contribute to these things, you can do it yourself and let me know in the Issues, and if it is a good fit for the project, we can discuss how to add it in.
